    <p><b>Python</b> is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.</p>
    <p><b>Python</b> is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>

    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>Python is Interpreted</b> − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Python is Interactive</b> − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Python is Object-Oriented</b> − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Python is a Beginner's Language</b> − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <h1>Python-Environment Setup</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Python is available on a wide variety of platforms including Linux and Mac OS X. Let's understand how to set up our Python environment.</p>

      <h1>Basic Syntax</h1>
    </header>
    <p>The Python language has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java.</p>
    <code>print "Hello, Python!"</code>
    <br>
    <code> if True:
      print "True"
      else:
      print "False"</code><br>
    <code>days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday',
      'Thursday', 'Friday'] </code><br>
    <code># First comment</code><br>
    <code>'''
      This is a multiline
      comment.
      '''</code><br>

      <h1>Variable Types</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>
    <p>Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>
